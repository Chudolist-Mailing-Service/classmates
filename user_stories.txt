---------------------

Stanislav, the original issue is fixed (it appears AWS needs the Flask class variable to be named 'application'), but there are a few todos, if you are intrested to work with. My aim is twofold - I want to be able to track the code and be able to maintain it myself, and also to build a small app to keep the list of my classmates. I what to go from one working prototype to aonother by adding a feature at a time and also make it very simple. 

My current list of issues outstanding is following:
1. I want the CLASSMATES dictionary to be importable from yaml + make it readable/printable in cp1251 so that I can see it in Windows. yaml.dumps/loads convert everything  to unicode/utf8 which is probably secure, but unreadable.
2. I want some nicer template for the table, nothing fancy, but better looking + add header to table columns. 

Issues listed at https://github.com/epogrebnyak/classmates/issues

Can further write in Russian.

---------------------

I would like to post on the web a minimalist web page, 
that will hold a list of my classmates (first name, last name),
employer, and a small pictogram of facebook with link to their page page.
The list of classmates should be readable from json/yaml like one below. 
I want to implement in bottle or flask + jinja. The framework must be in python. 

There should be a series of prototypes:

1. Local app:
1.1. Flask application that reads json/yaml and shows data in simple HTML table
1.2. Formatting of output page template to make it look nice

2. Deployment to remote hosting:
   - will need reccomendation of where to host (AWS?, Heroku?)
   - how orginal json/yaml file is protected on the server?
   - what is a convenient way to update json/yaml (e.g. keep all project in github private repo and updating it from there) 

3. Some other important steps that I might miss.
 
Out of scope of project, but in mind to develop later:
- login with facebook to access the page 
- same with vk and 

Please write your suggestions for framework/hosting + budget or hours for 1,2 and 3.

Please bear in mind I want to keep this one-page app maintainable by myself, so clean and easy 
solution are preferred, no overshooting (Django).
